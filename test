Each iovec entry specifies the base address and length of an area in memory
where data should be placed.  readv() will always fill an area completely
before proceeding to the next.

On objects capable of seeking, the read() starts at a position given by
the pointer associated with fildes (see lseek(2)).  Upon return from
read(), the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually read.

Objects that are not capable of seeking always read from the current
position.  The value of the pointer associated with such an object is
undefined.
